# Sound Files for InternHub

## FaceTime Call Sound Effects

For the FaceTime-like calling experience, we use two sound files:

1. `FaceTime_Calling_Sound.mp3` - Plays for the first 3 seconds when initiating a call (ringing sound)
2. `Facetime_Ring_and_Answer_Sound.mp3` - Plays after the ringing sound, indicating the call is being answered

### How the sound sequence works:

1. When a user initiates a call, the `FaceTime_Calling_Sound.mp3` plays for 3 seconds
2. After 3 seconds, the `Facetime_Ring_and_Answer_Sound.mp3` plays
3. After 1 second from the start of the answer sound, the call interface appears
4. This creates a realistic FaceTime-like calling experience with proper timing

Make sure to use royalty-free sounds or create your own to avoid copyright issues. Apple's actual ringtones are copyrighted and should not be used in production applications without proper licensing.
